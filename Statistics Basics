Given set find the mean ,median and mode

1 4 8 3 6 9

mean = (1+4+8+3+6+9)/6 = 31/6=6.1

media = 1 3 4 6 8 9 = middle number is (4+6)/2 = 5

mode = common among all 
     = if no common ,hence no mode 
     
     if the above data set is 1 4 4 8 3 6 9
      mode = 4
      
Range 
  It is the difference between largest and the smallest value 
        largest = 9 
        smallest = 1
         range = 8 
 
 Mid Range = average of largest and smallest number = (9+1)/2 = 5
 
 Mean Absolute deviation = (6.1-1)+(6.1-4)+(6.1-3)+(6.1-6)+(6.1-9)/6
 
 Interquartile range (IQR) = The IQR describes the middle 50% of values when ordered from lowest to highest. To find the interquartile range (IQR), â€‹first find the median (middle value) of the lower and upper half of the data. These values are quartile 1 (Q1) and quartile 3 (Q3). The IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1.
   sort the number      
    1 3 4 6 8 9
   middle number os 4&6
   median of 1+3/2 = 2 
             8+9/2 =8.5
    IQR = 6.5
